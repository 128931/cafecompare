<h2>Getting started</h2>
To compare two jar archives or two classes, you have to add them to the trees on the left.
<br>
On the top goes the old jar file, on the bottom the new version.
<br>
The left side of the decompiler panel will show the old code, the right side the new code.
<br>
Deleted code will be marked with red color in the left panel, inserted code will be green in the right panel.
<br>
If you want to remap class files by similarity, make sure the obfuscated file is placed in the bottom tree, and the (unobfuscated) source file in the top one.
Have fun comparing!
