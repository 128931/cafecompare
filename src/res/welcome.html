<h2>Getting started</h2>
To compare two jar archives or two classes, you have to add them to the trees on the left.
<br>
On the top goes the old jar file, on the bottom the new version.
<br>
The left side of the decompiler panel will show the old code, the right side the new code.
<br>
Deleted code will be marked with red color in the left panel, inserted code will be green in the right panel.
<br>
Have fun comparing!
